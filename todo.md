# Outlook to Planner Add-in Development Plan

This document outlines the steps to create an Outlook add-in that allows users to create tasks in Microsoft Planner from their emails.

## Phase 1: Requirements Gathering, Research, Proposal, and Design

*   [X] **Clarify User Requirements:** Gather all necessary details about the add-in's functionality, target audience, monetization, and user preferences.
*   [X] **Research Outlook Add-in Development:** Investigate the technologies and methods for building Outlook add-ins, including accessing email data and creating UI elements.
*   [X] **Research Microsoft Planner Integration:** Explore the Microsoft Graph API for interacting with Planner, including authentication, listing plans and members, creating tasks, and attaching files.
*   [X] **Research AppSource Publishing:** Gather information on the process of publishing an add-in to the Microsoft AppSource marketplace.
*   [X] **Create Detailed Proposal:** Based on the research, develop a comprehensive proposal including technical approach, user flow, UI mockups/description, estimated timeline, and AppSource overview.
*   [X] **Present Proposal to User:** Share the proposal with the user for review and approval.
*   [X] **Design Add-in Architecture and User Flow:** Finalize the technical architecture and detailed user interaction flow based on the approved proposal and create a design document.

## Phase 2: Development (Current Phase)

*   [X] **Set up Development Environment:** Prepare the necessary tools (Node.js, npm, Yeoman, code editor) and accounts for Outlook add-in development and Microsoft Graph API access.
*   [X] **Create Add-in Project:** Generate the basic Outlook add-in project structure using the Yeoman generator (`yo office`).
*   [X] **Azure AD App Registration:** Guide the user (or perform steps) to register an application in Azure AD to obtain a Client ID and configure permissions for Microsoft Graph API access (SSO and fallback OAuth).
*   [X] **Implement Core Add-in UI (HTML/CSS):** Create the basic structure and styling for the task pane (plan selector, assignee selector, due date picker, title/description fields, create button, status area).*   [X] **Implement Email Data Extraction (Office.js):** Develop the JavaScript logic to retrieve the subject, body, and save the selected email as an .eml file using the Office JavaScript API.
*   [X] **Implement Microsoft Graph API Authentication (JavaScript/Office.js):** Implement secure OAuth 2.0 (SSO with `Office.auth.getAccessToken()` and fallback manual OAuth flow) for accessing the Microsoft Graph A*   [X] **Implement Planner Plan Selection (Graph API & JS):** Develop the feature to fetch and display the user\'s available Planner plans in the dropdown..*   [X] **Implement Assignee Selection (Graph API & JS):** Develop the feature to fetch and display members of the chosen Planner plan in the assignee dropdown.
*   [X] **Implement Task Creation Logic (Graph API & JS):** Develop the functionality to create a new task in the selected Planner plan with the extracted email details (title, description, due date, assignee)*   [X] **Implement .eml File Attachment (Graph API & JS):** Develop the logic to upload the .eml file (e.g., to OneDrive) and attach it as a reference to the Planner task..
*   [X] **Implement Error Handling and User Feedback (JS & UI):** Add robust error handling for various scenarios (no email selected, API errors, permission issues) and provide clear feedback to the user in the UI*   [X] **Develop Minimum Viable Product (MVP):** Integrate all developed components into a functional MVP that allows creating a task from an email with basic details and attachment.

## Phase 3: Testing and Validation

*   [X] **Internal Testing:** Thoroughly test all functionalities of the add-in in various Outlook environments (desktop, web, new Outlook).
*   [ ] **User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Staging:** If possible, provide a staging version for the user to test and provide feedback.
*   [ ] **Iterate Based on Feedback:** Make necessary adjustments and bug fixes based on testing and user feedback.
*   [ ] **Validate Functionality and User Experience:** Ensure the add-in meets all requirements and provides a smooth user experience.

## Phase 4: Documentation and Deployment

*   [ ] **Prepare User Documentation:** Create comprehensive, step-by-step user guides on how to install, configure (if needed), and use the add-in.
*   [ ] **Prepare Technical Documentation:** Document the add-in's architecture, code, API usage, and setup instructions for future maintenance and for the user to understand the development.
*   [ ] **Prepare AppSource Submission Materials:** Gather all required information and assets for submitting the add-in to Microsoft AppSource (manifest file, descriptions, screenshots, privacy policy, support URL, terms of use).
*   [ ] **Guide User Through AppSource Submission:** Provide step-by-step assistance to the user for publishing the add-in via Partner Center.
*   [ ] **Package and Deliver Final Project Files:** Provide the user with all source code, documentation, and necessary files.

## Phase 5: Post-Launch

*   [ ] **Monitor Add-in Performance and Feedback.**
*   [ ] **Plan for Future Updates and Maintenance.**
